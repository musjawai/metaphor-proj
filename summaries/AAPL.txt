Apple's third-quarter earnings release is highly anticipated as the company reported revenue declines in the first and second quarters of this year. The decline in revenue is attributed to softer demand for laptops and iPads due to the slowdown in remote working caused by the pandemic. The key metrics to watch for Apple's stock performance are revenue, gross margin, and diluted EPS. In the prior quarter, CFO Luca Maestri predicted a decline of about 3% in revenue for the third quarter. Gross margin has been a competitive advantage for Apple, especially during declining sales. Diluted EPS performance will indicate how well Apple is managing softer sales. 

In addition to these headline metrics, more granular metrics to watch include iPhone revenue, which is Apple's flagship product and generates most of the company's revenue. Mac revenue declined in the prior quarter, but Apple launched new products in the third quarter, including MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro. iPad revenue also saw a year-over-year decrease in the second quarter. The wearables, home, and accessories segment, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, generated more revenue than the Mac or iPad segments in the second quarter. Apple's services business, including the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud, is the second-largest segment in terms of revenue after the iPhone. 

Maintaining or improving gross margin advantage relative to competitors is crucial for Apple, both in products and services. The services business has higher margins than the iPhone segment and is a strong and growing area for the company. 

In the previous earnings release, Apple outperformed analyst expectations for EPS, revenue, and gross margin. iPhone sales had a standout second quarter with 2% growth in revenue.
