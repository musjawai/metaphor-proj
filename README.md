# metaphor-proj

playing around with metaphor

The class in main.py makes an object that takes a stock ticker and generates a vector db that stores a couple of news articles from this past quarter. The user can query this database to ask specific questions.

For example,
I generate the db for the ticker "LEN," a construction company based on the East Coast. I ask it "What are LEN's plans for the next quarter." It gives relevant information from the vector db.
